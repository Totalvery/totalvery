# Totalvery

  Totalvery helps you compare the price, the estimated time of arrival, and offers between the top food delivery services such as UberEats, DoorDash, and GrubHub.

## Instruction

_First of all, you need a __US IP__ because some apps where Totalvery crawls data in real-time may not be available in your country other than the US. You can set a US IP with VPN. Then, you have to install __Docker__ in order to build the environment._

To run this app:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/Totalvery/totalvery.git
   $ cd totalvery
   $ docker-compose down -v
   $ docker-compose up --build
   ```

Check your CONTAINER ID of the 'totalvery_web' IMAGE:
   ```
   $ docker ps
   ```

It will be like this:
   ```
   $ docker ps
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
   7468f0fe33d5   totalvery_web        "python manage.py ru‚Ä¶"   19 minutes ago   Up 19 minutes   0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp   totalvery_web_1
   ca269c4f4a10   totalvery_frontend   "docker-entrypoint.s‚Ä¶"   19 minutes ago   Up 19 minutes   0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp   totalvery_frontend_1
   016f221cbb3b   totalvery_my_db      "docker-entrypoint.s‚Ä¶"   19 minutes ago   Up 19 minutes   27017/tcp                totalvery_my_db_1
   ```

Replace [CONTAINER ID] with the most top ID that you checked above:
   ```
   docker exec -it [CONTAINER ID] python manage.py makemigrations
   docker exec -it [CONTAINER ID] python manage.py migrate
   ```

For exeample:
   ```
   docker exec -it 7468f0fe33d5 python manage.py makemigrations
   docker exec -it 7468f0fe33d5 python manage.py migrate
   ```

Then you can see the demo web page with your local computer:

 üëâüèº  http://localhost:3000/


 _* Logging will be on your terminal. If you think the program's not working, check your terminal._

# Learning Outcomes

- Coding with team
- Using Docker to code in equal environments
- Using React to build frontend
- Using Bootstrap for frontend design and development
- Learning how to use Javascript, HTML and CSS
- Using Django REST Framework to build API 
- Connecting MongoDB with Django for better performance
