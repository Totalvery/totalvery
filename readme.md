# Totalvery

  Totalvery helps you compare the price, the estimated time of arrival, and offers between the top food delivery services such as UberEats, DoorDash, and GrubHub.

## To-do

- [x] Create a Totalvery API that returns a restaurant list around the user and the information of a restaurnat by aggregating data from all the delivery apps
- [x] Connect a MongoDB
- [x] Implement functionality to filter restaurants based on the user preference
- [ ] Implement functionality to enable users to link their account with UberEats, Doordash and GrubHub, which helps Totalvery provide more reliable information about estimated fees

## Instruction

_First of all, you need a __US IP__ because some apps where Totalvery crawls data in real-time may not be available in your country other than the US. You can set a US IP with VPN. Then, you have to install __Docker__ in order to build the environment._

To run this app:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/Totalvery/totalvery.git
   $ cd totalvery
   $ docker-compose down -v
   $ docker-compose up --build
   ```

Check your CONTAINER ID of the 'totalvery_web' IMAGE:
   ```
   $ docker ps
   ```

Replace [CONTAINER ID] with the ID that you checked above:
   ```
   docker exec -it [CONTAINER ID] python manage.py makemigrations
   docker exec -it [CONTAINER ID] python manage.py migrate
   ```

Then you can see the demo web page with your local computer:

 👉🏼  http://localhost:3000/


 _* Logging will be on your terminal. If you think the program's not working, check your terminal._

## Usage of Google Cloud

- Google Places API
  - Used for address autocomplete at search bar
- Google Maps Javascript API
  - Used to show map for the searched location

## Uniqueness Compared to Other Similar Apps

- Includes promotion deals
- Offers user to filter restaurants based on their preference 
- Also, we plan to show membership-applied fees and offers by connecting accounts

<!-- Docker 위에서 makemigrations 또는 migrate 하는 법

1. 터미널에서 docker ps 커맨드를 입력합니다.

```

docker ps

```

2. 위에서 얻은 결과로부터 CONTAINER ID 값을 알아낸 후 다음과 같이 실행시켜 줍니다.

```

docker exec -it [CONTAINER ID] python manage.py makemigrations

```

```

docker exec -it [CONTAINER ID] python manage.py migrate

```
